# PromptShare
I will share my own prompts here.
I came into contact with ChatGPT at the end of 2022, and then gradually came into contact with prompt. I will share my progress here.

-People with missing teeth is my first attempt at writing a complex prompt
-Daiyu Lin is inspired by a Chinese novel <Dream of Red Mansions>, she is a well-known character, currently chatgpt can't grasp all the details in prompt, so I didn't add more character traits.
-About null, it seems to be suitable for chatting hahahaha
